* Here Activity/Fragment is basically the view that user can see. 
* All the data that is been updated in the view or any action is handled from the viewmodel
* ViewModel communicate with the repository, which fetch the data(Api calling)

* **Model**:- Model represents the data and business logic of the app. Eg: Repository classes, response model classes,helpers etc.
* **View**:- In this pattern, the view role is to observe (or subscribe to a ViewModel observable to get information in order to change UI elements accordingly.
* **ViewModel**:- ViewModel interacts with model and prepares data that can be observed by a View between view and model. Has no reference to the view.
